# AIRSHIPS

Giant airships, also known as dirigibles, once ruled the skies and captured the imagination of people around the world. They were the first aircraft capable of controlled powered flight and were used for both passenger and cargo transportation. For a time, they were even considered a serious rival to the new airplanes. These majestic vessels were often compared to floating palaces, with luxurious cabins, dining halls, and observation decks that allowed passengers to experience the thrill of flight in comfort and style. Despite their popularity and promise, airships eventually fell out of vogue and largely disappeared from the skies. 

In the 17th century, Jesuit Father Francesco Lana de Terzi, sometimes referred to as the "Father of Aeronautics", published in 1670, a depiction of an "Aerial Ship" backed by four copper spheres from which the air was vacated. In 1709, the Brazilian-Portuguese Jesuit priest Bartolomeu de Gusm√£o created a hot air balloon, the Passarola, ascending to the skies, before an awestruck Portuguese court. However, the more profound work on dirigibles took place in the 18th century, as many aviators came forward and tested them. 

Lieutenant Jean Baptiste Marie Meusnier in a paper entitled "Memorandum on the equilibrium of aerostatic machines" presented to the French Academy on 3 December 1783 described the flying ship. In 1851, during the great exhibition, the Australian William Bland sent designs for his "Atomic Airship." This was an extended balloon with a steam engine driving twin propellers suspended beneath. On July 2, 1900, the Luftschiff Zeppelin LZ1 completed its first flight, made by a german military officer named Ferdinand, Graf von Zeppelin. German airship in the coming years become the most successful airship, it was named after Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin who began working on rigid airship designs in the 1890s.





## NOT YET COMPLETED STILL WORKING ON IT. @ THE AIRPORT.... BEAR WITH ME PLS

The advantage of airships over airplanes is that static lift adequate for flight is induced by the lifting gas and mandates no engine power. This was an enormous benefit before the middle of World War I and stayed an edge for long-distance or long-duration operations until World War II.

## Why Did Airships Fall out of Favor?

Despite their early promise and successes, giant airships eventually became disfavored for several reasons. One of the primary aspects was the high cost of building and handling these massive vessels. It required a large crew, expensive maintenance, and frequent refuelling, all of which added up to considerable expenses. Airships were limited by their size and speed. Although they were capable of carrying large amounts of cargo or passengers, they were not as efficient or speedy as planes. As airplane technology continued to enhance and become more widely available, airships became less and less competitive in the marketplace. Another factor that contributed to the decline of airships was safety concerns, with a series of accidents eventually dooming them.

There was a lot of accident recorded. The Hindenburg disaster was the most famous example of a fatal airship failure, but there were several other incidents that raised concerns about the safety of these vessels. One was the Akron disaster in 1933, which would result in the loss of 73 lives and be attributed to structural failure caused by bad weather.

Airships were also vulnerable to bad weather conditions. High winds, thunderstorms, and other environmental factors could cause consequential damage to these fragile vessels, which were made of lightweight materials such as aluminum and fabric. The greatest drawback of the airship is size, which is paramount to raising performance. As dimension increases, the hardships of ground handling advance geometrically.

According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), only 128 individuals in the United States are skilled to fly airships. And only 17 of them are hired to fly them full-time. Further, while it usually takes flyers ten to 15 hours to learn how to fly a single-engine aircraft, it takes 250 to 400 hrs of training for a captain to fly a solo trip on an airship.

**Lastly**, the main reason we never see airships in the sky anymore is because of the massive costs it takes to build and operate them. Airships are very expensive to build and pricey to fly. They require a large portion of helium, which can cost up to US$100,000 for one trip.

Unfortunately, as most airships used hydrogen rather than the far less common helium, they had a tendency to go up in flames, most infamously detailed and shown by the Hindenburg disaster in 1937.

## My thoughts on whether Airships technology might still emerge in the future

Airships were once seen as the future of transportation before airplanes and faster means of travel took over. Despite their popularity and promise in the past, airships eventually fell out of vogue and largely disappeared from the skies. But i think that it is definitely possible for Airships to emerge in the future because it has been gaining interest in recent years and with new advancements in technology and increasing focus on sustainable transport, there might be a renewed interest in their potential.
