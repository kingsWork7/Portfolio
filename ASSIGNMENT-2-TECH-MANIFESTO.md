**_What impact does technology have on my life?_**

### Communication and Relationship

As technology has advanced, communication has become faster, more convenient, and more accessible than ever before. However, as with any change, there are both positive and negative consequences that come with the integration of technology into our daily lives. While technology has undoubtedly made communication more efficient and accessible, it has also had a profound impact on our ability to connect with one another on a human level.

I understand that when we communicate digitally, it can be difficult to convey emotion and nuance, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunication. As we rely more on technology for communication, face-to-face communication has decreased which can lead to a lack of social skills and an inability to connect with others on a deeper level. It can also lead to a lack of empathy and a decrease in our ability to read nonverbal cues. But for my case it was the only option I have. At the age of 16, I moved to the Netherlands on my own, and it was a fascinating journey for me. In the beginning, I was full of excitement about my new life there. I attended football training twice a day, and I was eager to share my experiences with my family and friends back home. At that time, Facebook was the best way to share photos, videos, and communicate. However, the biggest challenge I faced was the unreliable internet connection. Often, it took a long time just to log into Facebook, and there were times when I would fall asleep while waiting for the connection to load. This made it difficult for me to stay connected with my loved ones and share my experiences.

**_And how would I (like to) see this in the future?_**

So imagine if hopping on the internet can be as simple as turning on a light. This new technology could revolutionise Wi-Fi.

Light Fidelity, also known as Li-Fi, uses the power of light to transmit data. Unlike Wi-Fi, which uses radio waves to create a wireless connection, Li-Fi relies on light to transmit data. Through this process, Li-Fi promises speeds that are 100 times faster than Wi-Fi. 

Li-Fi functions as a Visible Light Communications system; at its core, data is transferred from LED light bulbs. With Li-Fi, data is transferred at an accelerated rate compared to Wi-Fi, resulting in higher speeds. Speeds aren't the only important factor in a wireless connection. Security is another key advantage of Li-Fi because the signals are confined to the area illuminated by the light source and cannot penetrate walls. The risk of unauthorized access is greatly reduced.

Back to the topic of speeds, Li-Fi speeds could reach up to 224,000 megabits per second (in theory) and could be particularly advantageous for smart cities, virtual reality, 4K streaming and even online gaming, where lower latency is crucial.

So having lived alone since the age of 16, without my family and siblings scattered across different parts of the world, Iâ€™ve come to deeply appreciate the importance of technology as my primary means to communicate, stay connected, and share emotions with my loved ones. Li-Fi will make it easier to maintain long-distance relationships and stay connected with friends and family who live far away by providing faster, more reliable internet connections. With its high-speed data transfer, sharing experiences in real-time through video calls, photos, and messages will become seamless, allowing for stronger emotional bonds despite the physical distance.

# WEBSITE DEMONSTRATION

I created a website prototype with Gptengineer to showcase how Li-Fi internet works, featuring interactive demonstrations and detailed explanations of how data is transmitted through light, highlighting its speed, efficiency, and potential to revolutioniee wireless communication.
