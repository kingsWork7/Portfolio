# TIME BOXED 

On September 23rd, we had a FedEx Day at school, starting at 9:30 AM and ending at 16:00 PM. Our teacher explained that it was a pressure cooker (a highly intense task), fast paced challenge, so there would be no official lunch break at our usual time of 12:00 PM. Instead, we had to decide with our group when to take our lunch break. Our teacher instructed us to form groups of four students and randomly select a piece of paper, each with a different topic written on it.
