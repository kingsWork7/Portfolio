> ### Show your skills in rapid innovation, teamwork and problem-solving.

On Tuesday September 24th, we had a workshop and project called AI Hackaton. The workshop served as an introduction to new AI tools and demonstrated how to use them to rapidly create products or prototypes efficiently. The project part of the workshop was about the purpose and format of the AI-hackaton, Your team composition, challenge you tackled and the time constraints we worked under. 

The project coordinator, Mr. Diederik, along with his colleague, introduced several fascinating AI tools that will be highly beneficial for our studies. These tools can be used to quickly develop websites, apps, and prototypes. Some of the tools they introduced and taught us to use include:

- **Yousayaido.com**: A platform for building rapid prototypes.
- **gptengineer.app**: A tool for using AI to assist in code generation and development.
- **Mermaid.js.org**: A tool for creating diagrams and visualizations through text-based definitions.
- **huggingface.co/spaces**: A popular platform for AI models and applications, where users can explore trending projects.
- **aicomicfactory.com/playground**: A creative space for generating AI-powered comics and visual storytelling.

These tools vary in function from guided AI-powered coding assistance to visual content creation, and can be beneficial in quick development across different domains.

They are also showed and informed us two about platforms designed for modern web development and deployment. they include 

**Netlify**: Used for deploying and hosting static websites and web applications.

**Vercel**: Similar to Netlify but is especially tailored for deploying Next.js applications, although it supports other frontend frameworks as well. 

They further explained that they streamline the process of deploying, hosting, and managing web applications, especially those built with static site generators or frontend frameworks.

## MEET THE GROUP ( NEXUS )
![team](/uploads/91c7ab7d2600f636ec1583097032523c/team.png)

**Role in the team:** My role in the team as a media student was brain storming with the whole team about problem, generating the concept with the given AI tools, and providing all the media data or materials needed for the project e.g generating the two AI photos about the problem and concept. I tried creating a prototype with "YousayIdo" but the server wasn't running. I also used CHATGPT but my prototype wasn't good enough for the concept and team.

### PROBLEM
**Tips and recommendation:**
Chat with AI to figure out the root of the problem, do a brainstorm session with the group. 

**Problem Statement**: People struggle with effective time management, and current tools lack the adaptability and intelligence to provide personalized, real-time assistance for optimizing schedules and priorities.

### IDEA
**Tips and recommendation:**
Brainstorm with AI Chat models to on your ideas, look for inspiration and get creative

**Concept**: Our AI assistant helps users manage time and scheduling by using a task-based leveling system that rewards progress and boosts productivity.

### PLAN

**Tools that you will use**

- YouSayaAIDo
- Gpt Engineer
- ChatGPT
- GitHub
- Discord
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript 

### DEVELOP

**Requirements:**
Screenshots of the first and final iteration.

# LEARNING EXPERIENCE

My experience in this project has helped me to become a better team builder, brainstorm ideas quickly and combine suggestions with my teammates to find right doorstep solutions. I have also gained valuable knowledge on using AI tools to develop rapid prototypes and interactive websites with functional backends. Before now, there are so many things I dint know AI could do. For instance, I never expected AI, like ChatGPT, to help with backend development. But now with tools like GPTengineer that was revealed to us on this project, I can now build both front-end and back-end components of a website in just minutes.

This experience has given me important skills that will be useful in future rapid innovation scenarios. First, the ability to collaborate efficiently in a team under tight deadlines in fast-paced environments. The team building and brainstorming techniques I practiced here have helped me get better at working with others, sharing ideas quickly, and finding solutions together. These are key skills for projects focused on innovation in my future.
