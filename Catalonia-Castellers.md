# The World's Largest Human Tower Show

On Wednesday, October 2nd, Alex informed us that we received a proposal from the Castellers. He mentioned there is a massive event held every two years, where all the groups from Catalonia come together to participate in the Castellers tradition. This event in Catalonia is a vibrant tradition where teams, called colles, build human towers, or castells, that can reach up to 10 levels high.

On Saturday 5th, We went with the whole team and cultural people of Lleida to the Arena in Tarragona. We were all excited about the opportunity to witness this great event. We were also informed that we will participate in building the tower. I was very excited about the about the teamwork from people from other culture, strength, balance,trust they have in us as foreigners in their land, and as participants to collaborate to form these towers.

The experienced I had in this event is marked by excitement, their traditional music and chants, and a strong sense of community, as the goal is not just to create the tallest structure but to celebrate unity and mutual support in the process.
