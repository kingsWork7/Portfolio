# DUTCH HISTORY AND CULTURE

On September 11th, I joined fellow minor students on a field trip to Amsterdam. We traveled by bus, departing from the school building at 8:10 AM. The trip was incredibly engaging and interesting, as it provided an opportunity to explore and learn more about the Netherlands, Its history, culture, geography, and its people. Arriving in Amsterdam, the first place we visited was the Holland 5D Experience Center at Overhoeksplein.

As we made our way into the building, each of us participated in a short quiz titled "THE DUTCH KNOWLEDGE" on screens along the hallway. The quiz focused on the culture and history of the Netherlands. I scored 6 out of 7, largely because I have lived in the Netherlands for 10 years and have gained a good understanding of its history.

Next, we entered a hall with a large screen displaying a presenter, and behind her, a video played showcasing the history of the Netherlands. The video highlighted the country's landscape, forests, plants, and especially the iconic Dutch flowers known as tulips. She informed the majority of tulip farms in the Netherlands are found in the coastal province Noord-Holland, and Flevoland in the middle. Considered the best place for tourists to see these lovely flowers is in the flower bulb fields along the coast from The Hague and Leiden up to Alkmaar in the north. She also informed us about the Afsluitdijk as one of the most iconic and ambitious engineering projects in the Netherlands, playing a crucial role in the country’s battle against the sea. Constructed between 1927 and 1932, the Afsluitdijk is a 32-kilometer (20-mile) dam that connects the provinces of North Holland and Friesland. She also said the need for such a project became urgent after several devastating floods in the 19th century, particularly the flood of 1916, which highlighted the vulnerability of the Zuiderzee.

Lastly, we had an incredible 5D virtual experience on a swinging coaster that made us feel like we were flying across the entire Netherlands. Securely seated with tight seat belts, we soared through virtual landscapes, including the sea, forests, the king’s palace, roads, farms, and mountains. One particularly breathtaking scene was when we flew over the ocean, dodging massive waves as though we were piloting a jet. The immersive experience felt almost real, and I had never encountered anything like it before. It was an amazing and unforgettable day at the Holland 5D Experience.

### Boat Tour 

After the 5D experience, we boarded a free ferry to Amsterdam Central Station and took a walk to the dock before arriving at the Lovers Canal Cruises. Here, we had the opportunity to embark on a captivating boat tour through Amsterdam’s iconic water canals. As we stepped onto the cruise boat, we were provided with headphones to listen to the captain’s insightful narration throughout the journey. As we sailed along the canals, the captain vividly described the rich history of the city, pointing out historic houses, renowned museums, and various boats docked along the canal's edges. The narrative not only detailed the architectural beauty of Amsterdam but also provided deeper insight into the significance of the canal system itself.

One of the highlights was learning about the Dutch Golden Age, a time when the Netherlands was a major player in global trade. The captain explained how the extensive network of waterways and the construction of powerful ships contributed to the Dutch becoming some of the wealthiest traders in the world. The canals were key to helping trade and transportation, making Amsterdam a major trading center at the time. It was a fascinating experience that gave us a better understanding of the city's history and how important its waterways were to its success.

At 1:30 PM, we finished the boat trip and proceeded to take a walk through Jordaan and the famous Red Light District. We explored the city for about an hour, finishing the walking tour by 2:30 PM. Afterward, we had some free time to enjoy in Amsterdam.

# LEARNING EXPERIENCE

First, the 5D Experience provided me an immersive way to learn about the history, culture, and landscape of the Netherlands, making education feel interactive and engaging for me. Through the virtual tour, I gained knowledge about the country’s iconic landmarks and also get a sense of its cultural heritage and natural beauty in a fun and exciting way.

The boat cruise through Amsterdam’s famous canals gave me a deeper understanding of the city’s history, especially during the Dutch Golden Age. Hearing about how the canals shaped Amsterdam's growth and its role in global trade brings history to life in a way that classroom learning cannot.

Lastly, being surrounded by students from different countries offers a unique opportunity to learn from diverse perspectives. Engaging in discussions with people from various cultures gave me a better understanding of the world, and broadens my cultural awareness. The entire experience promotes not only my academic growth but also my **personal development**, as i have gained insights into the importance of diversity and the power of shared experiences.
