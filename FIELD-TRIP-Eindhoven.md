**On September 10, 2024**, we had a field trip in Eindhoven, near the school, as part of our Minor program. All the students and the teacher gathered in front of the TQ4 building at 9:15 AM to walk to 'De Tuin'. It took us about 30 minutes to walk there.

When we arrived at the location, "De Tuin," we met a man prior to who the teacher already told us about, who is an invasive plant scientist and ecologist. He introduced himself and explained that he would be guiding us around "De Tuin," a large area in Eindhoven filled with trees, woods, water, and both invasive and non-invasive plants and flowers. He brought out a map and explained what we would be doing. He also mentioned that he would be sharing the history of many of the plants and trees in "De Tuin," as well as his personal experiences in the field of ecology.

## Japanese Knotweed (Fallopia japonica)

This is one of the first few invasive plants he showed us. He informed us that Japanese Knotweed (Fallopia japonica), is a highly invasive species known for its fast growing, dense stands, if you cut them, they will regrow. It has heart shaped leaves, small white flowers, and bamboo-like stems. He explained that the japanese Knotweed is notorious for its aggressive spread, often outcompeting native plants and causing damage to other plants and landscapes. He also said it is important to control it properly, the roots are so strong as it can regrow from even small fragments of its root system.

## Himalayan Balsam (Impatiens glandulifera)

Another invasive plant disturbing the tuin is Himalayan Balsam (Impatiens glandulifera) with pink flowers. This plant is known for its characteristic pink or purple flowers and can grow in dense clusters, especially near water bodies or disturbed land. It is highly invasive and spreads rapidly, often outcompeting native species. He told us this plant came from roman empire in the old days of battle when they where transporting flowers from Rome to europe. Some of this invasive plants fell on the ground resulting to what we have now in Eindhoven.

He also said Himalayan Balsam is a major concern in many regions due to its ability to dominate ecosystems, reducing biodiversity and contributing to soil erosion along riverbanks when it dies back in winter. Itâ€™s typically controlled through manual removal or other environmental management strategies.

## English oak (Quercus robur) 

He didn't explain much about this invasive plants. he told us that ehe English oak can take over areas outside its native habitat because it spreads quickly through its seeds and there are 450 unseen insects that leaves on european english oak, and 30 unseen insects living on the American version of the plant . He said it competes with local plants for sunlight, water, and nutrients, which can push native species out. This can lower biodiversity and lead to areas where only the oak thrives, making the ecosystem weaker and more vulnerable to pests and diseases.

## Giant Hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum)

The last invasive plant he talked about was Giant Hogweed which can grow up to 4-5 meters tall. He told us that it is highly invasive, spreading rapidly in open areas like riverbanks, roadsides, and meadows. It can outcompete native plants and disrupt local ecosystems. He also added that, the plant poses a significant health risk because its sap can cause severe skin irritation and burns when exposed to sunlight. Although some student dare me to touch it as an experiment to see what will happen to my skin, i didn't do it. Lastly he said when dealing with invasive weed plant, it's important to handle it with caution and contact local environmental authorities for proper removal procedures.
