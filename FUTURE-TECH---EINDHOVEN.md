# HOFSTEDE'S CULTURAL DIMENTIONS 

## Curiosity 
At the start of the semester, our teacher divided us into small groups of 4 or 5 students. I was placed in a group of five, and I consider myself fortunate to be with students from diverse cultural backgrounds. Arthur is Dutch, Andrea hails from Belgium, Carla and Tiaan are from South Africa, and I am from Nigeria. Each of us brings unique perspectives shaped by our different nationalities and cultural experiences, creating a rich environment for intercultural learning and collaboration. This diversity has not only broadened my understanding of global perspectives but also enhanced our group dynamics. Everyone coming from different cultural background makes me curious, I have a genuine interest in finding out about their cultures, and looking forward to our everydayÂ intercultural encounters.

As a group, we regularly participate in retrospectives and 360-degree feedback sessions. Through these retrospectives and individual group feedback, I learned that each team member has a unique approach to giving feedback and communicating. I learned that Dutch students tend to provide direct and straightforward feedback, while Belgians are more indirect in their approach. South Africans, influenced by their respectful African culture, offer polite feedback. I make an effort to understand and adapt to each person's feedback style, considering their cultural backgrounds.

### Experience and Cultural difference

A student from Spain named Alex lived with me in Eindhoven for the first three weeks of the minor program. Due to the housing shortage in the Netherlands, it was difficult for him to find a place to rent, so we made an exchange: he stayed with me, and I would live with him in Spain later. Coming from different cultural backgrounds, we shared many experiences. Alex is quiet, friendly, and full of energy. While we had our differences, such as him eating late at night due to Spanish culture while I prefer to eat earlier, we adapted. We cooked separately, but whenever he cooked before me and saw that I was about to prepare my meal, he would kindly set his food aside and wait for me to finish so we could eat together.
