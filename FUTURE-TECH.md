# INTRO - FUTURE TECH

The rapid pace of technological progress and the immense potential of new technologies requires adaptive students with a broad perspective. Not only on the (future) possibilities of technology, but also on the effects on people and society.

In addition, these developments require a high degree of creative ability. Developing new, unusual applications for existing or future issues, exploring the limits of technology and, with this, responding to the society of the future. This creative ability is an essential skill when it comes to innovation.

# VISION ON TECH

Technology is progressing rapidly, and it is changing the way we live, work and play. I see a lot of new inventions happening, almost every day. Conventional concepts we are used to as a human race for decades or even centuries are being disrupted by cutting edge technology. Just 50 years ago, computers were mainly used for scientific research, but today they are everywhere, in all shapes and sizes, powering many aspects of our daily lives. We have small, portable devices like smartphones, and larger ones like desktops and mainframes. Recently, with innovations like Google Glass and Snap Spectacles, computing power has even made its way into wearable devices.

With these new innovations, modern advancements in technology and the rapid rise of AI,I envision a teleportation device to revolutionise human transportation by enabling rapid, seamless travel between continents, such as Europe and America, in mere minutes. Using advanced technology, this device would dematerialise individuals at their starting point, transmit their molecular structure through a highly sophisticated quantum network, and reassemble them at their destination with perfect precision. This innovation would remove the time limits and environmental problems of traditional travel, providing a fast and eco-friendly way to move around the world. By using the latest quantum physics and teleportation technology, my vision is to connect the world in a way that's never been done before, creating endless opportunities for personal, work, and cultural exchanges.

# VISION ON PROJECT

Decades ago, water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) spread from its native ecosystem in Amazonia, Brazil, and became an invasive species in water bodies across the globe. It also reached Africa and has ever since eaten into a number of lakes in South-Africa, such as the Hartbeespoort Dam in pretoria, Lake Tana Ethopia and Lake Victoria, Kisumu Kenya. 

Measures to remove the hyacinth all over the world have mostly been either through chemical treatments or manual removal. Either way, they have proven extremely ineffective and expensive. For instance, the municipal corporation in Ooty spent millions to clean the lakes in the tourist town, only to find it growing back. In Bengaluru indian, the Indian Army deployed 7,000 of its personnel to clean the Ulsooru lake, and their efforts had proved futile. In Africa, efforts to control the growth of water weeds were attempted by methods such as physical removal, chemical and biological control, but all of them have not been highly efficient. 

Therefore our vision as a team is to help Hartbeespoort Dam is located in the Northwest Province of South Africa, approximately 40 kilometers west of Pretoria, restore back water flow in the dam, sunlight penetration back into the water and increase oxygen levels, by using Remote sensing, and AI-enhanced digital twins help monitor and predict plant spread, ensuring timely intervention and efficient resource use. This will restore a thriving aquatic ecosystem. The clear, open waters will support abundant fish populations, rejuvenate local biodiversity, and create healthier habitats for wildlife. With the dam free of invasive species, it will become a sustainable resource for fishing, tourism, and recreation, benefiting both the environment and the surrounding communities. The project will serve as a model for effective ecological restoration, ensuring the long-term health and resilience of Hartbeespoort Dam.

# INNOVATIVE CONCEPT ON PROJECT

The water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) as a fast growing aquatic plant from South America, has spread to many parts of the world, including South Africa, where it is considered one of the most invasive species. Known for its vibrant purple flowers, this plant poses serious environmental and economic challenges, clogging waterways, reduces biodiversity, and disrupts ecosystems by outcompeting native plants. Julie Coetzee, the project stakeholder, a member of NRF – SAIAB, SARChl, Ecology and Management of aquatic invasive species and Central of Biological Control, Rhodes University South Africa informed us how ecology is being investigate and how this aquatic invasive species are being manage in South Africa. To help do this they built a biocontrol rearing facility as part of the SISONKE ('work together') program, where they provided employment opportunities for individuals with physical disabilities. They rear insects to increase the population of insects that feed on this invasive plants by releasing them at targeted locations. This process has helped to control and reduce the spread of water hyacinth plants but hasn't finally stop the increase and growth of the invasive plant. 

Therefore, my group and I conducted further research to investigate the reasons behind the significant increase in water hyacinth growth in Hartbeespoort Dam. Our main research question was **"_What strategies can we devise to mitigate the swift proliferation of the invasive species (water hyacinth) in Hartbeespoort Dam?_"** From this question, we brainstormed and generated sub questions which lead to our main three Concepts.

### Concept 1 - Solution to reduce pollution and invasive plant growth​

Our first concept was to introduce a filtration system that cleans incoming water, reducing nutrient levels, and ultimately limiting the aggressive growth of water hyacinth. This concept would help lessen phosphorus and nitrogen entering the water, reducing the resources that fuel water hyacinth growth, which will also improve the water quality.

### Concept 2 - Human Powered-Bike

The system uses human-powered bikes to generate energy that powers a vacuum cleaner, which removes debris and invasive plants from the lake. Riders log into their accounts, tracking their energy contribution and lake cleaning progress, adding a competitive edge. This actually combines environmental cleanup with fitness, creating a sustainable, community-driven solution.

### Concept 3 - Data Like Images

There are already biological countermeasures in use to help fight the water hyacinth. This concept will use data like images of the dam, wind direction, wind speed and dam currents to determine where water hyacinth is on the dam and where it is going to move on the dam aiding in tracking and early detection of the plant. To replace the expensive satellite images this concept employs drones to get arial photos. The key benefit of this concept is that this data combined with machine learning algorithms will be used to detect and track the hyacinth.
