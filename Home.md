## About Me

I am a fifth semester ICT and Media Design student at Fontys Hogeschool in Eindhoven. I am also participating in a Minor program called Global IT to combine international IT aspects and trends in IT with intercultural aspects, and to actually experience this in an international setting. I enjoy coding in visual studio with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am currently following five different courses this semester which are Future Tech, UX design, IoT, Ai and Data Science. Attending these IT programs in different countries is not just about acquiring technical knowledge, it’s about becoming a global citizen. The amalgamation of diverse educational experiences and intercultural competencies i will gain will equip me with a unique perspective and skill set. 

Furthermore, I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. I also believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time.
