When I arrived at Barcelona Airport for my flight to Austria for the next module, I saw four of my classmates from South African. Understanding the importance of cultural awareness and interpersonal communication, I approached them and asked if they were on the same flight. They confirmed they were, which was a pleasant surprise and made me excited, as it meant I wouldn’t be traveling alone. We exchanged greetings and chatted for a while until it was time to board the plane.


# Empathy and Intercultural Sensitivity

Upon arriving in Austria, it was quite late, around 10:30pm and we needed to catch the last train from Vienna Airport to Linz. Being a new person in the country, it wasn’t very easy to navigate to our destination, but we managed to get our tickets just in time. With only 10 minutes left before departure, we quickly boarded the train. We had two stops, the first at Vienna Central, where we made a transfer, and then continued to Linz, our final destination.

On the first train, some students felt uncertain and curious if we boarded the correct train due to the rush with which we entered into the train. I was leading the way, So I felt responsible for ensuring we were on the right train. Discussing with another student from south africa about our current location on Google Maps, an Austrian lady in the train overheard us. Sensing our worry, she showed empathy by reassuring us that we were on the correct train. She also offered to assist us further with our journey and assured us that we would reach our destination. This particular experience highlights the value of intercultural competence in moments of uncertainty. The lady proactive help and kindness make we realise how nice Austrian people could be. Her action demonstrated an understanding of how to support foreigners in a new environment.


During the journey, I was incredibly hungry, because I have not eaten all day. I was complaining to a classmate how hungry I was. Another Austrian girl seated on the opposite side to my right overheard me and, to my surprise, reached into her bag and handed me a snack. I was surprise and also grateful, because I didn’t realised she understood English while I was talking with my classmate. I had thought everyone on the train speaks German. 

Few minutes later the girl and her friend gave us another snack. We were surprised and touched by the kindness of the Austrian people, because it was our first real encounter with them. 

# CELEBRATING DIFFERENCE

On Wednesday, October 30th, the school organized a Halloween party as part of its annual tradition. The event took place on campus, with a special invitation extended to all students, both international and local. To build my intercultural competence, I decided to attend the party to meet new people and make friends, especially since I hadn’t gone outside so much in  the village since arriving from Spain.

### Intercultural Communication

Before going to the party, I met a student from the Czech Republic who was also studying at the same university. We chatted for a while, he asked where I was from and complimented my hairstyle, he was joking that he will borrow my hairstyle for the night, because his costume was pirate with a similar hair. He asked me to take a photo of him and his friend.

At the party, I spotted many of my classmates from the minor program, all dressed in different costumes. After exchanging pleasantries with them, I headed straight to the bar for a drink. While waiting, an Austrian student who also wanted to buy a drink struck up a conversation with me by asking what I was ordering. We exchanged our drink choices. He initially spoke to me in German, but when I told him I could only speak English or Dutch, he switched to English and asked where I was from and what brought me to the university. I explained the minor program to him and mentioned that I will only be in Austria for just three weeks. When I asked where he was from, he told me that he was Austrian and lived here in Hagenberg. We enjoyed our drinks together and chatted for most of the night, talking about the party and football. He jokingly suggested that many people, especially the ladies, would like me for my looks and costume. He also play football for an amateur football team and invited to come play with him. I guess i made a friend based on **cultural empathy** and **intercultural bonding**. 


### Meeting a student from last year's minor program

While I was standing in a corner at the party, another Austrian student approached me. His name was Jan, and he asked if I was from Fontys University of Applied Sciences. Being **Curious**, I asked him how he knew. He pointed out the university name on my shirt. He then told me he was part of the minor program the previous year and enthusiastically shared how much he had enjoyed it. Jan mentioned that his two favourite countries were the Netherlands and South Africa, describing the events they participated in during their time in South Africa and encouraged me to be ready for similar experiences. After chatting for a while he left. I was genuinely excited by the warmth and friendliness between people from different cultural backgrounds as mine, and how our conversation flowed effortlessly.

##  STRANGE BEHAVIOUR 

### Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions - UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE 

### Being mindful

Later, at 1AM., when Jan was leaving, He came back over to invite me to an after-party about 10 minutes away from campus. Which i find very strange and awkward. I was nervous and stressed because it was very late at night, inviting me to a place i don't know at night was frightening. I told him I couldn’t make it to the after party because it was already late at night and that I have an appointment with semester coach in the morning. Although, I was nervous, but I have a strong cultural background in uncertainty because in such situation i was very compulsive, yet security conscious.

### GROUP WORK - The Lewis Model (Richard Lewis)

At the end of the module, I faced a challenging moment with my group after we received feedback from the teacher on our CIF document. The teacher mentioned that while the executive summary was very good, a small part was missing. He then pointed out errors in the other three sections of the document and asked us to make corrections. As the group leader, I shared the feedback with everyone and assigned each member to work on their section. However, the next day, someone in the group replaced the entire document with a new version. I explained to them that creating a completely new document wasn't a good idea since the teacher already had the original, and we just needed to apply his feedback. The student disagreed, insisting that we should inform the teacher that we decided to redo the document from scratch. That is when the Lewis Model came into play. I have a very good listening orientation, respect of others, and also consider their viewpoints. Even when their disagreement left me feeling speechless and a bit heartbroken.

# MEETING A NEW FRIEND IN VIENNA

During my stay in Hagenberg, I registered a social app to also meet people online. Since it was very quiet in Hagenberg, I wanted to connect with people who could keep me company and busy online. Through the app, I met a girl named Carla who promised to take me for a tour in Vienna. We chatted for several days, got to know each other better, and became friends. I told her about my minor program in Hagenberg, and she mentioned she had never been to Hagenberg. As we talked, we discovered that we shared similar hobbies and enjoyed the same music. She invited me to a music concert in Vienna before the tour. I told her after my final presentation on the 7th, I will come to Vienna. In Vienna, we went to the concert, and the next day a tour around Vienna. The atmosphere at the concert was warm and welcoming, with friendly strangers enhancing my experience of Austria's rich musical culture. 

The next day we went to some Museums and also the Government parliament.  we also shared our religious beliefs, family background, and occupations. I After lunch, she accompanied me halfway to the airport. We hugged and said goodbye, and I went to take my flight to Brussels.

To conclude the different experiences i had in Austria, I would say that this Halloween party offered me a unique opportunity to connect with people from different cultural backgrounds in an open and welcoming environment. Despite our diverse origins, everyone I met was incredibly kind, open, and curious, making it easy to bridge cultural gaps and find common ground. 


I was able to exchange social contacts, make friends, and share meaningful conversations, which reinforced the power of empathy and openness in intercultural interactions. This experience shows me how stepping into new social gathering and engaging with others can enhance my understanding, respect, and appreciation for diverse cultures. I left the country not only with new friendship but with a deeper sense of how positive, inclusive interactions can bring a connected and happy community.
