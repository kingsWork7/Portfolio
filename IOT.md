### LEARNING OBJECTIVE

My learning Objective for this module is to equip myself with a solid foundation in IoT fundamentals, covering key topics like LoRaWAN and MQTT for seamless device communication with cloud services. I also want to learn how to connect, calibrate, and gather data from various sensors, such as pH, temperature, and TDS sensors, to monitor and interpret environmental conditions in real time. Additionally, I would like to gain experience with GPS for location tracking which will be very good for the goal of the project (Tracking and monitoring water Hyacinth), collecting latitude, longitude, and altitude data to enhance practical applications. 

I would love to know how to work with The Things Network, manage IoT devices like ESP32 Mini, ESP32 WROOM, and the connectivity/data transmission, using MQTT for efficient messaging. Lastly I would also love to develop a simple, interactive dashboard to visualise sensor data, focusing on user friendly design for clear data representation. And enhance my skills in code combination, optimisation and maintaining stable connections. 

### PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT

This module was very educative with a lot of advanced, high standard technologies. I developed myself personally by gaining hands on skills in IoT technologies, including configuring devices like EPS32, connecting sensors, and using protocols like MQTT and LoRaWAN, which increased my confidence in handling tech driven projects. By developing a stronger analytical mindset working with sensor data and dashboards, improving the ability to interpret data from IOT devices into the TTN and MQTT, which later displays on our dashboard. Although working with frontend and backend together in a group of five is quite difficult, I developed my ability combine codes and debug complex systems, which builds resilience and adaptability when working on technical challenges.

### Learning Experience

As the module involves working with multiple IOT devices, working in a group of 5 with just one IOT device at a time was very challenging. One of the learning experience we observed was how to plan, divide, and execute tasks within a group setting, to encourage time management, organisation, and collaborative skills. Designing dashboards or simple interfaces to display live data wasn't easy, because it was my first time designing a dashboard with a real-data. I learnt a lot by emphasising a user-friendly layouts and effective data visualisation. I also learned the importance of being patient with my group members while they worked on their parts, allowing us to combine our code and understand each other's contributions in the end. This approach helped us integrate different aspects, such as the frontend and backend, and discuss how they connected the device so that I could effectively merge my work with theirs.

### Group 360 Feedback

Exactly the same way we did our 360 feedback from last module. On our way to belgium, my team decided to conduct a 360 feedback session online for this module. Below are the feedbacks I received

Hey Kingsley, good work on this module! I really liked the initiative you took on the frontend. It was a hard module to work as a group, but nevertheless you took great initiative and you had an attentive ear about what everyone had to say, for example when I proposed to focus on the sensors over the drone and we could use the prototype made in the UX module, but with sensor data rather than drones, you really thought about it and made valid points. 

I have really no complaints at all about your work this module so keep up the good work!

Hay Kings. I have nothing but compliments, man. You did amazing work with this module. As soon as we started with the web interface, you showed of your skills and why you are such an asset to our team. Keep on doing you because you did amazing:)
