# HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN

**In this module we will focus on iterative design process in which designers focus on the users and their needs in each phase of the design process. In HCD, design teams involve users throughout the design process via a variety of research and design techniques, to create highly usable and accessible products for them.**

# GOAL

The goal of this module is to learn the skills and knowledge necessary to create user-centered, intuitive, and visually appealing interfaces and to understand the principles of user experience and user interface design, emphasizing how to design digital products that are easy to use, accessible, and meet the needs of the target users.

## Understanding the user's needs

Generally, there are 4 Phases in User-centered Design. Each iteration of the UCD approach involves four distinct phases. First, as designers working in teams, we try to understand the context in which users may use a system. Then, we identify and specify the users’ requirements. A design phase follows, in which the design team develops solutions. The team then proceeds to an evaluation phase. Here, you assess the outcomes of the evaluation against the users’ context and requirements, to check how well a design is performing. More specifically, we need to see how close it is to a level that matches the users’ specific context and satisfies all of their relevant needs. From there, We make further iterations of these four phases, and we continue until the evaluation results are satisfactory.

To kick off our project and engage our users effectively, we created detailed personas, user profiles, and user scenarios. These will help us understand our users goals, behaviours, and challenges. Ensuring that our solutions are tailored to their specific needs and provide the best possible user experience.

### USER PROFILES

We created 5 potential user profiles that suits out concept ideas. “ Employing drones to get arial photos of the dam, wind direction, wind speed. Detecting where water hyacinth is on the dam and where it is going to move on the dam aiding in tracking and early detection of the plant”.  The five user profiles we created were Farmer, Fisherman, Tourist, Boater and one for our main stake holder from The Center for Biological control in South Africa.

## User Stories and User Profiles
For better understanding of the needs, goals, and behaviors of the target users we created a some personas and User stories.

# PROTOTYPE

Based on our concept idea which is to use data like images of the Hartbeesport dam, wind direction, wind speed and dam currents to determine where water hyacinth is on the dam and where it is going to move on the dam aiding in tracking and early detection of the plant. To replace the expensive satellite images this concept employs drones to get arial photos. We as a group (Nexus) therefore created various prototype, like paper prototype, Medium fidelity prototype and and high fidelity prototype representing how our final product will be for our target users. 

### Dashboard

Before we started creating our prototypes, we had a lecture a the topic called -"**dashboards**", during this lecture we were shown a presentation slide illustrating the ideal structure of a dashboard. The first slide provided an example of a dashboard design, highlighting key elements such as key performance indicators, overview, depth, interactivity, and actionable insights. 

![dashboard](/uploads/f19ac570575dba20486cca6c491c55de/dashboard.png)

Additionally, the topic covered how to implement and create visually appealing palettes using Adobe Color. This therefore provided us with a clear idea and example of how our final prototype should look upon completion.

### Paper Prototype

As a team we brainstormed and concluded that starting with a paper prototype is very important because it allows quick and low cost idea generation. We knew that with just pen and paper, we could rapidly sketch out our concepts dashboard for our target users, also test different designs, and get immediate feedback without investing time in complex digital tools. So, at first I made a paper prototype to formerly show how our future end product would look like. On the Homepage of the sketch we have the basic layout of the header, the body and the footer. The header contained the navigation bar, the footer contain the our groups socials and information, while the body part contains basic layout of widgets. 

**_Home Page_** 

The home page have a basic sketch outlining our team’s vision for the first page of our user interface. As a media design student, I took the lead in designing the home page. I began by adding a header with five boxes for the navigation bar and included a written logo placeholder. In the body, I sketched five widgets, two circular and three rectangular. My team and I agreed on a minimalistic design, with a simple layout, that would make the home page easy to navigate and visually appealing.

**_Including History, Prediction , and Drone page_**

The other pages we sketched are the History page, Prediction page, and the Drone page as shown in the PDF above. On the History page, we added widgets but initially weren't sure what content to include, so we decided to leave that for the medium fidelity phase when we would brainstorm further. For the Prediction page, we sketched out three widgets and button. On the Drone page, we added two rectangular boxes to help structure how we envisioned the drones recent captures.

# LOW FIDELITY PROTOTYPE - JUSTINMIND

The wireframe we made is a replica of the paper prototype but in digital form. Before we start making our various prototype, we were giving a lecture on “JustInMind”. A powerful design tool that enables designers to create interactive, high-fidelity prototypes for web and mobile applications. Its intuitive interface allows us to build detailed wireframes, simulate user flows, and test user interactions, providing a realistic preview of our final product. With this tool we replicated our paper prototype with same layouts, widgets and boxes as shown on the pdf below.

# [MEDIUM FIDELITY PROTOTYPE](https://cloud.justinmind.com/usernote/prototype/63dedc7d12fe955e933c528645c10aa701ce5ae976e38db8a121d65729a01c65)

[**ALL MEDIUM PROTOTYPES**](/uploads/5b393903fe16d5c48bb6de1bc4ad178a/MediumFidelitypro.docx)

On this prototype, I started to implement more design on the wireframe templates. Although I wanted the medium fidelity prototype to look more advance. So I actually design all the pages from scratch. What I mainly did was to have the same layouts, structures, widgets and boxes. This time around, I added colours, written words, structured the navigation bar with links to different pages, added socials to the home page and some photos.

# [FINAL PROTOTYPE](https://cloud.justinmind.com/usernote/prototype/faf5179191f2a2e08ed0e3daa4d1c55b5f879f21cf7a2ffc7022360e21a673eb)

After progressing through the low and medium fidelity prototypes, we designed the final version of our prototype which represents a fully functional and interactive design by improving what we had from earlier stages, and incorporating all feedback from teachers, inter-group evaluation and usability testing from targeted users. As a group we started designing the final prototype by brainstorming what we would like to have on each page of the final product and how to implement it. The first step we took was deciding to upgrade our medium fidelity by incorporating all the necessary functionalities on each page, what will be on each widgets  and the necessary informations on the widgets. As you can see below, the image on the left was the medium fidelity containing just  the basic layouts, header, footer, widgets and a few written words. On the High fidelity prototype shown in the image on the right, I started with the navigation bar on the header by increasing the size of the logo, and placing colours around each words on the navaigation bar to highlight the current page the user is viewing. We embedded sub-widgets within the main widgets to show what content will appear on each page when a widget is clicked. In addition, I added links to the widgets, serving as shortcuts for users to easily navigate from individual widgets to the main page that contains all the related content.

My teammates focused on worked the history and prediction pages. On the history page, they included past predictions, while the prediction page showcased future forecasts, both illustrating the movement of water hyacinth. These pages presumed to use real time data and images captured by drones flying over Hartbeespoort Dam to provide accurate insights into the past and future spread of the hyacinth. Images representing the two pages are shown below.

<img src="/uploads/e9ef7a121e9683740d4c3db76a3170bb/History.png" width="400" length="120" >

I also created the final page which is the drone page. Containing the amount of drones that will flying over the hartbeespoort dam, revealing the spread of water hyacinth, and the percentage coverage on the water surface. On the same page the user can also see the active drones and the recent picture they took, and also the non active drones with error message like there is an issue possibly due to a server issue, connectivity problem, or data corruption, Or a technical failure because a drone encountered an issue and became stuck, either during flight or while capturing images.

To summarise the whole process and what I've learnt from creating this high fidelity prototype. I understood that the final prototype maintains the core structure established in the earlier stages, with a refined layout and polished visual elements like buttons with names on the widgets, our logo, links from one page to another, pictures and update of the current situation on Hartbeespoort Dam, picture from drones showing the curent state of the dam and the amount of water hyacinth coverage and also buttons to switch language for our potential users. Bellow is the link to final prototype created with "**Justinmind**".

# USABILITY EVALUATION

### Expert Evaluation

After finalising and designing our final prototype we conducted two specific types of Expert Evaluations. The first was with the teachers of this module, and the second one was with other groups from our class. 

**Teachers Evaluation** 

The teacher's evaluation was a mandatory part of the module, to guide and assess whether we had successfully implemented and iterated the feedback we received throughout the design process, from the low-fidelity prototype to the final version, and also to ensure it was functioning properly and had a user-friendly interface. Before beginning the user evaluations with the teachers, it was mandatory in this module to provide a Consent & Recording Release Form for them to sign. The consent form was for the user to agree to participate in the task conducted and recorded for us. 

_Feedback from Rosa_: When you make a graph it is important to show what you are measuring. On the Drone page, I interpreted that the page is okay, there is a sign of critical error on one of the drones. Sometimes when you design, there should not be a lot of space, and also try to improve your space. 

_Feedback from Toni_: First question "Why are you recording me?". You should not explain to your user where to go on your web application. Now i can navigate easily and i understand it better. It will be better if you can reformulate the Task. 

After navigating through our prototype, we provided the teachers with a digital questionnaire to complete. The purpose of this questionnaire was to gather their feedback and rate their satisfaction with the usability and overall experience of our prototype.

**Inter-Group Evaluation**

The teachers randomly assigned groups to evaluate each other's prototypes and provide feedback. Our group was tasked with evaluating the prototype created by the Hunters, while our prototype was to be evaluated by the Reclaimers.

The Reclaimers: Some useful feedbacks and recommedation given to us by the reclaimers following the 10 Rules of Thumb Design Guildlines

1. Add visual indicators (e.g., highlighted tabs, progress bars) to show the
current page and active processes.
2. Use more intuitive labels and map representations in the predictions
and history sections.
3.Add "back" and "cancel" buttons for easier navigation and undoing
actions.
4. Add keyboard shortcuts or customisations for expert users to navigate
faster.
5. Excessive white space on certain pages, reducing overall functionality.
6. Add a help section with documentation, tooltips, and tutorial guides.

These feedback from the reclaimers helped shape our final prototype to the latest version we have right now. After receiving the feedback from the reclaimer, we decided to implemented the most useful ones before embarking on the evaluation with some target users. 

# EVALUATION WITH USERS 

The primary goal of testing the prototype with users was to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the user interface. The tests were conducted using  Justinmind, a prototyping tool that allows for creating and simulating interactive prototypes, enabling precise data collection on user interactions and usability. 

During the usability test, 15 participants, who matched the target demographic, were invited to perform a series of representative tasks on the prototype. Each participant was greeted by us as a group, asked to sign a consent form, and given instructions on how to interact with the prototype using Justinmind. They were informed that they could withdraw at any time during the test. None of the participants had prior experience testing the website application. Throughout the test, we refrained from assisting the participants, even when they encountered a little challenge with the Justinmind setup. 

### Results 

**The following data was collected for each participant**:  

-  Number of tasks completed without assistance  
-  Time to complete all tasks  
-  Number and types of errors  
-  Participants recommendations 
-  Participant’s satisfaction about the system. 

After doing the tasks, participants were asked to do the post – test questionnaire. It was created with the System Usability Scale. The average of points was: 70.71. 

**Major Findings**: 

- Users found the system very easy to use. 
- There were a few problems related to using the prototype in a web browser. 
- The users wanted us to show what we are measuring on the graphs 
- Some system functions were not as intuitive as they could be. This might be due to users' lack of familiarity with the application, although all participants stated they could use the system easily after a few minutes of learning. 
- The overall score of the application on the SUS scale was 70.71, which is classified as "good." 

**Areas of improvement** : 

- Minimize the amount of blank or unused space in the prototype pages. 
- Add an optional tutorial to guide users on how to navigate and use the application. 
- Enhance the drone error button to be more interactive and responsive, displaying a popup error message when clicked or hover	

# REPORTS

Some of the report we got after the usability testing are detailed on the metric board below

![metric](/uploads/50202a9e3276295dad0a844c2dea35a6/metric.png)

# COMMON INDUSTRY FORMAT ( CIF DOCUMENT ) 

This document is primarily for reporting results of formal usability tests in which quantitative measurements were collected and is particularly appropriate for summative/comparative testing. " The CIF does not actually tell you
what to do, it rather tells you how to report on what you did" . 

The CIF contains four sections which are detailed on the document I will attached below

1. Executive Summary 
2. Introduction
3. Methods
4. Results

# Learning Objectives

My learning objective for this module is to improve prototyping Skills by developing the ability to design, create, and iterate on prototypes by using the new sofware ( Justinmind) introduced to us in this module. I also planned to apply user centered design principles to create a user-friendly interface that allows stakeholders (e.g., Center for biological control, drone operators) to easily monitor and track the movement of water hyacinth. Lastly to learn more how to conduct usability testing on the prototype and iterate on the design based on feedback, ensuring the final product is intuitive, effective, and aligned with user needs.

# Personal Development

My approach to personal development in this module was very interesting and engaging. As a Media student and the Group Leader in this module, I knew this module would be important for expanding my existing knowledge in UX/UI design. I followed every lecture and task closely, so i could increase my skills and stepping up as a leader for my group. I was extremely committed throughout, focusing on improving both my personal and professional growth.

### Skills Developed

Being my first time as a leader of a group, I developed a huge mindset of how to carry everybody on the team along, by starting every project, classworks, engagement and also creating various platforms to record and share task. As the leader I made sure most problems were solved and assignment were submitted directly to the teachers, and every deadline was met. Being the most quiet in the group, I also developed a good communication skills, so I could start most of our brainstorm sessions and answer questions from other group member, as one of the task of the group leader is to always know what we have to do. 

### Learning Experience

The learning experience I mostly had in this module was the willingness to be a group leader. I knew this role comes with a lot of challenges. Some of the challenges were learning how to communicate with other team members as a leader. I didn’t want nobody to be offended if I asked them to do a task, so I have to apply everything I learnt from intercultural competence like the Hofstede’s rule of collectivism. I needed to emphasize on relationships and loyalty of the group instead of individualism. 


## Reflection

This module was a wonderful experience for me. Maybe because of my expectation as a media designer or what I was willing to learn. At the end I was grateful for all the knowledge I acquire in this module. When the module started I wasn’t the group leader, but because of the huge interest I have for design, I needed to tell my group I wanted to be the leader, which they all accepted. As a media student, I made sure I did the most part of the important task. I was already used to Figma for interactive prototype, so when we were introduced to Justinmind software, I also took the responsibility to create all the layout and designs for our final prototype, because it was quite similar to figma. The effort I gave in this module, gave me the newly acquired skills I have in return. Looking back to when I arrived in Spain and the day I left, the knowledge I have acquired is very huge. For example, I didn’t know about CIF document (Common Industry Format), and signing the consent form from every target users. This were all new to me and I am glad I learnt this, and will take this with me into my professional field as a Media Designer. 

At the end of the module, I faced a challenging moment with my group after we received feedback from the teacher on our CIF document. The teacher mentioned that while the executive summary was very good, a small part was missing. He then pointed out errors in the other three sections of the document and asked us to make corrections. As the group leader, I shared the feedback with everyone and assigned each member to work on their section. However, the next day, someone in the group replaced the entire document with a new version. I explained to them that creating a completely new document wasn't a good idea since the teacher already had the original, and we just needed to apply his feedback. The student disagreed, insisting that we should inform the teacher that we decided to redo the document from scratch. This disagreement left me feeling speechless and a bit heartbroken.

### Group 360 Feedback

Before starting the new module, my team decided to conduct a 360 feedback session online for this module while we were on our way to Austria for the next module. Below are the feedbacks they shared with me as the group leader via WhatsApp.

**Arthur**

Your work this module was amazing. I like how you took more initiative from the start by taking the role of team leader on you. Especially since your previous feedback was to be more proactive and take more initiative. Thumbs up for that!

Your ideas and work really helped our group to design a good looking application and we could not have done it without you. 

You were a good team leader and I really enjoyed this module with you. I honestly have no complaints, just keep on being you 🙂

**Andre**

Hey Kings, you did a great job during our UX module. You were always ready to participate during work hours, and your part in the presentation was spot on. You also did a really awesome job as team leader.

No complaints from me, keep up the good work!

**Tiaan**

Hay Kings. You were in my eyes definitely our MVP for this module. We would have been much worse off if it was't for you.  Your key eye for design was crucial to our success, and I definitely learned from you regarding simplistic designs and how they are better for the user.

I have to give you props for the way that you took ownership of the leadership role and how you stepped into the role with confidence when we decided that you should be the leader for the UX module instead of me because of your UX background.

You did amazing in this Sprint. Just keep being you because you bring something to the table that no one else has 😇
