Upon arriving in Spain, it felt like I had stepped into an entirely new world. I flew from Eindhoven Airport to Girona, but a 5 hour delay at Eindhoven caused me to miss my train from Girona to my final destination (Lleida). With no other options, I had to book a hotel and spend the night in Girona. My first interaction with Spanish people happened at the hotel. The staff there were friendly and highly attentive. After my observation that the staff were naturally attentive and friendly, I became curious to know whether this was just their general nature or if they treated me with respect simply because I was a customer or client. 

In the morning, I asked the receptionist to help me call a taxi to take me to the train station, where I planned to catch either a train or another taxi from Girona to Lleida. When the taxi arrived, we headed to the station, and there I found a Spanish ride-sharing service called BlaBlaCar. The driver was supposed to pick up random passengers along the way for the 2.5 hour journey, but, luckily for me, I was the only passenger for the entire trip.

### Nonverbal Communication Patterns

This was my second encounter with a Spanish citizen "a male taxi driver". As the journey began, I realised this was the perfect opportunity to satisfy my earlier curiosity from the hotel, were people who works there was genuinely friendly. 

#### Kinesics
As the journey began, the driver was eager to talk and communicate with me throughout the entire trip. The only challenge we faced was the language barrier because he spoke little to no English, and I didn’t understand any Spanish. Still, we found a way to communicate using hand gestures, body language, and Google Translate. He enthusiastically shared the history of Catalonia, the region we were in, pointing out significant landmarks like the iconic mountain that symbolizes Catalan pride, the flags, and other scenic mountains. What stood out to me was how excited and passionate he was while sharing these details. He was incredibly friendly, and I felt safe, almost as if I had known him for a long time. He even opened up about his family and his love for hiking, pulling out his phone while driving to show me photos of his hiking adventures in the mountains.

What I observed with both the taxi driver and the hotel staff was a noticeable cultural difference between Spain and the Netherlands. In Dutch culture, people tend to approach interactions in a more business-like and professional manner. While they can be friendly, they usually maintain a certain level of professionalism. From my personal experience, a Dutch taxi driver wouldn’t casually tell you about the history of North Brabant unless you asked, nor would they freely share details about their family or hobbies unless they knew you well. In contrast to this, in Spain, people seem more open and warm. The taxi driver, for example, eagerly shared stories about Catalan history and his personal hobbies without any prompting, which felt much more informal and friendly.

## Culture in Lleida (Spain) 

Lleida is deeply rooted in Catalan culture. Notice I didn’t say Spanish culture, but Catalan. Yes! Upon arriving in Lleida, I was warmly welcomed by Aleix and his family. Since he had lived with me in the Netherlands, it was now my turn to stay with him in Spain. During my journey from Girona to Lleida, I noticed a particular  flag hanging along the way and on the mountains. When I arrived at Aleix’s house, I saw the same flag displayed both at the front and back of the house. We had a welcome dinner with his parents and sister, where we talked about life in the Netherlands, Nigeria, and the Dutch school system. After dinner, I asked them about the flag I kept seeing everywhere. They explained that it was the Catalan flag and that it symbolises their culture and identity. Although they are part of Spain, but they proudly represent Catalonia and its distinct heritage. All this time, on my way here, I assumed the flag was from a football team. It was only after satisfying my curiosity and asking about it that I discovered it was actually the flag representing an entire group of people and their culture.

### Teaching culture - Switch Codes (Adaptation)

The teaching culture in Spain is quite different from what I was used to in the Netherlands. I was surprised to learn that our classes start at 3 pm and end at 7 pm, whereas in the Netherlands, most classes begin at 9 am and finish by 4 pm. A few new friends mentioned that they have varying class schedules, with some in the morning and others, like us, in the afternoon. This experience is entirely new to those of us coming from different countries and cultural backgrounds. The teaching style of the teachers is also different. They rely more heavily on slides and detailed explanations compared to what I experienced in the Netherlands. This new approach can be quite exhausting for many of us, but we've quickly had to **adapt** to it in order to fit into our new academic environment and keep up with the course.

### Catalonia Castellers - The World's Largest Human Tower Event

On Wednesday, October 2nd, Alex informed us that we received a proposal from the Castellers. He mentioned there is a massive event held every two years, where all the groups from Catalonia come together to participate in the Castellers tradition. This event in Catalonia is a vibrant tradition where teams, called colles, build human towers, or castells, that can reach up to 10 levels high.

On Saturday 5th, We went with the whole team and cultural people of Lleida to the Arena in Tarragona. We were all excited about the opportunity to witness this great event. We were also informed that we will participate in building the tower. I was very excited about the about the teamwork from people from other culture, strength, balance,trust they have in us as foreigners in their land, and as participants to collaborate to form these towers.

The experienced I had in this event is marked by excitement, their traditional music and chants, and a strong sense of community, as the goal is not just to create the tallest structure but to celebrate unity and mutual support in the process.

# POLIRIZATION

My previous IDI pofile results indicated that my Developmental Orientation is within Polarisation, an orientation that makes sense of cultural difference from a more judgement stance ("Us" and "Them"). A form of defense or reversal.  

I was positive about my own cultural values and practices and that of other groups, and at the same time critical of another's cultural practice and that of mine own. In same case I was Defensive and in another case I Critical which actually makes my IDI profile result Polarisation. Overall this is not a bad outcome, as this an awareness of the challenges that can arise around cultural differences from good/bad, positive/negative view. 

To balance this evaluation (advantages and disadvantages) of my own and others' cultural beliefs and behaviours and identify the commonalities between my view and theirs, I did a task which i will show below
